VERSION 0.8

- added the getIdField function in order to make overriding the id column naming possible
- added the getLoadAllCursor in order to make linking to a data DataBoundAdapter possible

--- DEPRECATION NOTICE ---
- don't inherit AbstractModelBase any more! The "id" column clashes
  with the android convention of carrying and "_id" column, so I added
  a boolean parameter to force You making a review on Your model classes.
  You can either inherit LegacyModelBase (same behaviour like before) or
  - and this is recommended - alter Your tables by renaming the "id" column
  to an "_id" column. This restrict impacts when You try to fill view withs
  data using a cursor. So either You must consider using the LegacyBean
  or You should modify Your code.


VERSION 0.7
                                                     p
- Bugfixes wrong logging (wrong logger level instead of output logging level)
- Missing removal of data change listeners added
- now also look in active activities when asking for a bean class
- now also allow managed activities to validate themselves
- Bugfix : Resuming an activity requires dependency injection on the activity


VERSION 0.6
- IMPORTANT: made an APKLIB out of this project. Use type "apklib" now in Your maven dependency!

- added an unified error handling technique for view components (android style and ErrorView style)
- added an automatic view validation technique (ManagedFragment.enableFocusChangeBasedValidation())
- added a generic validation technique for declarative validation of view components
- moved from getManagedClass to constructor based solution carrying a final variable

- Single Parameter String resolve function
- some minor bugfixes and improvements on the application context
- StringUtil for easier TextView handling
- removed re-ordering of fields, now you MUST statically index Your fields in the Your beans.
  !! The prior function was buggy !!

VERSION 0.5

- prototype beans now supported. prototype beans are bean instances with DI that are no singleton for
  in-application use
- context now injecteable
- Exceptions in context and bean handling reused
